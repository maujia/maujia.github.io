  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Currently in 3rd year Engineering working on embedded software projects, and looking for opportunities in the biomedical space.
    This interest stems from my 2nd year, where I worked on the mechanical design for the an automative design team at Queen's and found that my interests lay more in bare metal programming.
    Outside of school, my hobbies include watching and playing sports, watching Veritaseum videos and exploring new countries.
